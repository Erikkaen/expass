1. First step
The first step I took was making sure that my repository and Git connection was correct from the last assignment.
The repository is public, and pushed through git bash with the name "main".
I added the plugin HTTP Client til Intellij. 
2. I started with attempting implementing the first draft of the PollApp domain model from the diagram.
I made the java beans and started making the get and set methods, and then also making the PollManager.
3. After this I implemented the controllers as well.
4. I tried to do the automate testing by making a pollapp.http file to see if the implementation works,
but I am very confused as I am struggling with activating the gradlew server. 
I tried to call all the functions I made and I keep getting errors. I might have a directory issue.
