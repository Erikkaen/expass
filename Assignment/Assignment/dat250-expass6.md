1. I started with downloading node, and then downloading Svelte.
2. I started looking up the syntax of the language with was alright, and decided to immediately add the
CORS, so I could see if I could get in and push out the right data when I made my functions in svelte files.
3. I made the three components mentioned in the introduction, and looked at the svelte examples from their homepage
to make the simplest setup I could, and added some design underneath as well. I saw a few examples as well.
4. I was satisfied and decided to deploy - I then saw at my design showed up at the localhost:8080. I no longer had
to run npm run dev. 
5. I tested the app and saw that I had to refresh to see that I created any user or polls or options, which is quite annoying.
I fixed this by updating the "nmp run build", there as probably a bug in a previous code.
