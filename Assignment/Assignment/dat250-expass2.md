DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

1. First step
   The first step I took was making sure that my repository and Git connection was correct from the last assignment.
   The repository is public, and pushed through git bash with the name "main".
   I then added the plugin HTTP Client to my Intellij.
2. I started with attempting implementing the first draft of the PollApp domain model from the diagram.
   I made the java beans and started making the get and set methods, and then also making the PollManager.
3. After this I implemented the controllers as well. All of this was quite time-consuming as it's been a while since
   I've programmed in java instead of Python.
4. I tried to do the automate testing by making a pollapp.http file to see if the implementation works,
   but I am very confused as I am struggling with activating the gradlew server.
   I tried to call all the functions I made and I keep getting errors. I might have a directory issue, but therefore I
   am not sure if my syntax is correct or if it's working. I tried to troubleshoot and see what I
   did in the expass1, but I can't figure it out with the time I have left.
5. I have dedicated a generous amount of time to understand what is happening in the gradle directory, and I have finally found
   the correct template to have everything function in Java, gradle and Spring. I mainly played around with right-clicking
   the folders, like source-main-java = and pressing "Mark directory as" -> "Sources root". I then managed to get intellij
   to cooperate, even though it is way past the deadline. After this I have played around with http and realize that I have to
   perfect my code, but this is for sure fixable and more fun.
